brainCloud is rapidly evolving to meet the needs of our development community. Software updates occur regularly at a pace of every month or two. We work hard to ensure that new features and fixes are additive, and do not break existing apps in the field. Where API methods need to be changed / discontinued, we give minimum 90 calendar days notice.
