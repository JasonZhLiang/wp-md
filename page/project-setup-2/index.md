We will go through creating a basic Unity project. For developers who have an existing Unity project, many of these steps can be skipped.

- Open Unity Editor
- Create project
    - File | New Project
- In the Project View
    - Create a folder called "External"
    - Create a folder called "Scenes"
    - Create a folder called "Scripts"
    - Extract BrainCloudClient.DLL and LitJson.DLL from the brainCloud SDK into the External folder
    - Extract BrainCloudWrapper.cs from the brainCloud SDK into the Scripts folder

Your Unity Project View should now look like the following:
