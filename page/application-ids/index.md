Key application identifiers. These identifiers are used when connecting your **client** to brainCloud, or for allowing brainCloud to connect to other **third-party services.**

Without these identifiers, you will not be able to pair your client app to your app on brainCloud. Be sure to keep your app identifications a secret

_Example of using the brainCloud plugin in Unity to automatically connect your appId and appSecret to your code base_

To see and edit your application ids, go to the Application IDs page on the \[su\_tooltip style="blue" position="north" shadow="yes" close="no" behavior="hover" content=" The web dashboard where you set up and configure your app details on brainCloud."\][dashboard](https://portal.braincloudservers.com/admin/dashboard?custom=null#/development/core-settings-information)\[/su\_tooltip\].

#### Pairing your app's identifiers

- Your **App Id** is your app's unique identification on brainCloud. No other app shares your app id, and it cannot be changed
- For your **App Name**, you can enter whatever value desired. Your customers will not see this value, so you could name one app "MyApp \[Dev\]" and another as "MyApp \[Live\]," to denote the \[su\_tooltip style="blue" position="north" shadow="yes" close="no" behavior="hover" content="No one likes to break live code. It's recommended to keep a development version of your app on release, to test new features and changes in a 'safe to break' environment."\]_**production and internal**_\[/su\_tooltip\] versions of your apps.
- Similar to your app name, your app's image is an internal picture that can be whatever you like to help represent your app on brainCloud. The example screenshot uses a brainCloud logo as the picture.
- Your **App Secret** is used to ensure the connecting being made to brainCloud belongs to your app.
- The **Show Game Design Features** controls whether gamification features like Achievements and Leaderboards show up on the brainCloud UI. You can uncheck this box to help clean up the UI, and re-enable the box should you decided to add these features at a later date.

If your app secret is ever leaked, it can be refreshed with the \[**Regenerate App Secret**\] button. Please note you must click **\[Save Changes\]** for the new secret to be saved.

Accidentally saved over your current app secret? You can enter a copy of your old secret into the App Secret box, and save your old secret. You can change your secret to any text value, however, a secure GUID, like the ones generated by the **\[Regenerate App Secret\]** button, is highly recommended.

When using features that require brainCloud to pair with other dashboard, you will have to enter those platforms associated idenitifiers in the Configure Platform section.

Now that you have access to your ids, let's pair your app with brainCloud.

string serverUrl = "https://sharedprod.braincloudservers.com/dispatcherv2";
string secret = "1234-1234-1234-1234";
string appId = "123456";
string version = "1.0.0";

\_bc.Init(serverUrl, secret, appId, version);

That's it, your app is paired with brainCloud by using your app id and secret. See the [Initialize](/apidocs/apiref/#wrapper-initialize) method in the API Reference for additional information and examples of other programming languages.

_If you are using the brainCloud Unity plugin, you only need to call \_bc.Init(). The app id and app secret will be auto-filled from the plugin. See further instruction on_ [_GitHub_](https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp/blob/master/README.md)
